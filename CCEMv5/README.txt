This is the v0.5 version

Main changes from v0.4
======================

(1) Move to PWh vs GToe (ton of oil equivalent)
(2) GreenGrowth is a yearly roadmap (not price) to represent possible acceleration
(3) Compute the growth of electricity production to produce electrification KPI
(4) Feedback loop = less people -> less production, with a “AIfactor” that reduces the impact (0 -> AI absorbs the reduction of workforce, or older non-productive people are more targeted)
(5) New CO2 concentration model (54%)
    It would be good to validate the IPCC prevision (delta CO2 to delta T) from 2020 to 2023
(6) Protectionism (import taxes, CBAM or public boycott) : reduce import/export based on difference in CO2/Energy and CO2taxes
(7) Energy transition is a political decision (a factor from 0 to 100% = fastest possible transition based on belief)
